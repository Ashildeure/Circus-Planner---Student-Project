# Circus Planner - Java FXML Application  

## 🚀 About the Project  
This project, named **Circus Planner**, was developed during the second semester of my first year in the BUT Informatique program. It is a Java application built using FXML and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.  

We developed this project as a team of five students using the **Scrum methodology**. By working in sprints and holding regular meetings, we collaborated effectively to create a robust and user-friendly planning tool for managing complex circus-related entities.  

## 🎪 Features  
- **Actor Management**: Create and manage circus actors.  
- **Objects and Animals**: Add objects and animals to the database for use in numbers.  
- **Number Creation**: Assemble numbers (acts) that include actors, objects, and animals.  
- **Show Management**: Combine multiple numbers into shows.  
- **Event Planning**: Organize events that include one or more shows.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Java**  
- **JavaFX (FXML)**  
- **MVC Architecture**  
- **Scrum Methodology** for team collaboration  

## 🌟 Learning Outcomes  
This project helped us:  
- Master JavaFX and FXML for building user interfaces.  
- Apply the MVC design pattern for clear separation of concerns.  
- Handle complex data relationships and ensure data consistency.  
- Collaborate in a team setting using Scrum (e.g., sprint planning, daily stand-ups, retrospectives).  

## 💡 Next Steps  
If we revisit this project, we’d like to:  
- Add a database for persistent storage of data (e.g., SQLite).  
- Implement advanced filtering and search functionality.  
- Improve the UI design for a more modern and intuitive user experience.  
- Integrate a reporting system for event statistics.  

## 📂 How to Run the Project  
The provided code is distributed as a Java module, grouped in the root *package* `fr.uga.iut2.genevent`.
The project is configured as an [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/idea/) project. The source files are in the `src` folder, the `persistence` folder is where the application stores the data.

```shell
$ tree -a -d -L 1 -I .git --gitignore --noreport -- genevent
